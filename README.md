# practice repository to start git

# Git

- git init - create a very new repository
- git status - compare working directory, staging area and current branch
- git add: add changes from working directory to staging area
- git commit: add commit changes from staging area to current branch
eg: git commit -m "added examples" README.md
- git config: set to get configuration
- git log - shows history of all project commits

git -merge - merge changes from different branches

merging means to bring changes from 2 branches together
fastforward commit

git branch --no-merged master
git diff
git merger --no-commit --no-ff <branchname>
git-practice$ git config --get user.email

git fetch: fetch changes from remote directory. You then need to merge
git pull: fetch and merge



### Whats a remote

Remote repository is one hosted somewhere other than you local.
